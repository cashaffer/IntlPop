<h1>IntlPop 3 Help Page</h1>

<p>
IntlPop 3 allows you to run simple demographic simulations using data
about countries or regions of the world to predict future population
trends.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
When you open IntlPop 3, you should see a map taking up most of the
interface pane, with a list of countries/regions immediately to its
right. At the top of the pane are a few buttons and some information
about which country/region is currently selected.
</p>

<h3>Using the Map to Select a Country or Region</h3>

<p>
In the lower left corner of the map are three radio buttons that allow
you to view the world by country, region, or continent. Just click on
the one that you want.
</p>

<p>
In the upper left corner of the map are +/- buttons to adjust the size
of what you see on the map.
You can move around the map by clicking and dragging in the desired
direction.
When your mouse cursor is hovering over a country or region, the name
should appear above the map in the "Current Hover" field.
</p>

<p>
You can select a country or region simply by clicking on it. At this
point, its name should appear in the "Current Selection" field above
the map.
</p>

<h3>Using the Country List to Select a Country or Region</h3>

<p>
You can scroll down the list of countries and regions to make your
selection. You can also cut down on the number of entries to look
through by typing a search string into the empty box next to the
"Select It" button.
</p>

<h2>Using the Simulation Window</h2>

<p>
Once you have selected your country or region to explore, click the
"Select It" button to open a simulation window.
You can select as many countries or regions as you like, and open as
many simulation windows as you like.
Each simulation window is independant of the others.
</p>

<h3>Running a Simulation</h2>

<p>
You can simulate the next step (10 years) for the current conditions
by clicking the "Sim &gt;" button, until you reach the end of the
simulation period (in 2090).
If you have run at least one time step, then you can back up by
clicking the "Sim &lt;" button.
</p>

<p>
The "Options" button allows you to start another simulation.
Any new simulation will start with the default demographic data.
(See "Changing the Scenario" below.)
You may run up to three simulations for comparison.
At any given instant, the population pyramid that you see on the
screen refers to the current timestep of the current simulation that
you are running.
The graph in the middle of the screen shows lines for each of the
simulations that you have run, each in its own color.
The box on the right side of the screen will show the year and
the corresponding population for the last timestep that you have run
for each of the simulations.
This allows you to see and compare the results of up to three
simulations in the graph and in the final population numbers.
From the Options menu, you can also reset the simulation (making
everything just like when you first opened that simulation window).
</p>

<h3>Changing the Scenario</h2>

<p>
IntlPop 3 allows you to change the state of the simulation in many
ways.
Making changes will then affect the projected outcome for the
simulation.
</p>

<p>
If you place the cursor over a bar of the population pyramid, then you
will see the absolute population for that cohort (a 5-year age range
for either males or females).
You can also change the value of the bar (shrinking or growing the
number of people in that cohort) by moving the cursor to the end of
the bar and then dragging it in or out.
When you adjust the value of a bar, the total population shown in the
box to the right of the simulation window will also update.
</p>

<p>
The "Fertility Rate" box shows the total fertility rate (the average
number of children that a woman will have in her lifetime).
Clicking on the button will open a box that lets you adjust this value
in a number of ways.
You can just type in a new value in the "Target Value" field.
If you do so, you can also adjust the "Target Year" field.
If you do not change the "Target Year", then your changed value will
be applied immediately to the simulation.
If you change the year to some time in the future, then the total
fertility rate will gradually change over time from its current value
to your target value, reaching the target in the year that you
specified.
If you click the "Adjust Individual Rates" button, then you will see a
list of 5-year cohorts and the actual number of children per thousand
women of the corresponding age.
You can then type in a new value to any of those cohorts.
Such changes will take place immediately, rather than over time.
The "Close" button will close the window.
</p>

<p>
The "Life Expectancy" box shows the life expectancy for an individual
born at that step in the simulation.
If you click the "Life Expectancy" button, then you will be able to
adjust various aspects of the mortality rates for the population.
Similar to the "Fertility Rate", you can adjust the overall life
expectancy by typing a new number in the "Target Value" field.
And you can use the "Target Year" field to make your change take place
gradually over time.
Changing the "Life Expectancy" will alter all individual cohort
mortality rates that the simulation uses.
IntlPop 3 does not give you any direct way to alter those mortality
rates individually.
However, you can adjust the Infant Mortality Rate (the number of
infant deaths per thousand births) by typing a new number into that
field.
The "Close" button will close the Life Expectancy window.
</p>

<p>
The "Net Migration" box shows the number of people in a given year who
move out of the country (if the number is negative) or into the
country (if the number is positive).
If you click on the "Net Migration" button, you will be able to change
this number.
If you do not change the "Target Year" field, then your change will
take place immediately.
If you change this field to a year in the future, then the annual
migration will be changed gradually over time until it reaches the
specified value in the specified year.
The "Close" button will close the Net Migration window.
