The data used in IntlPop 3 comes from the UN's World Population
Prospects database, available through
http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm.

We do not redistribute these files with our own distribution as they
take up nearly 40Mb and are not needed to run the program. We generate
our country files by first converting the orignal Excel files to CSV
and then running the script in tools/parseData.py.

If you would like to see a copy of the original data files, here is
what we use:
