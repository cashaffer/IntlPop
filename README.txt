Project home for HTML5/JavaScript International Population simulation
for introductory geography courses.

A public mirror for this repository is available at
http://geosim.cs.vt.edu/IntlPop. This provides an access point for
people who would like to see IntlPop in action.

IntlPop 3.0 is written in HTML5/JavaScript with jQuery.
Dropdown menu support (C) Cory LaViska, available from github.com/claviska/jquery-dropdown

HISTORY: IntlPop was originally created in the early 1990's as part of
the GeoSim project at Virginia Tech, written as a C application for
the PC.

The second version was written in 1999 as a Java applet. Unfortunately
the Java is so old now that many browsers have problems running it.
Also, it still uses 1990 country data. This is currently available at:

http://geosim.cs.vt.edu/Java/IntlPop/IntlPop.html. 

TO USE IntlPop 3.0: Opening index.html in a browser window will give
you an embedded version of IntlPop.html. That really only gives you
the ability to open one or more simulation windows (instances of
Simulation.html), where all the action takes place.
