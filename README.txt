IntlPop
=======

Project home for HTML5/JavaScript International Population simulation
for introductory geography courses.

A public mirror for this repository is available at
http://geosim.cs.vt.edu/IntlPop. This provides an access point for
people who would like to see IntlPop in action.

IntlPop was originally created in the early 1990's as part of the
GeoSim project at Virginia Tech, written as a C application for the
PC.

The second version was written in 1999 as a Java applet. This is
currently available at:

http://geosim.cs.vt.edu/Java/IntlPop/IntlPop.html

TO USE: Opening index.html in a browser window will give you an
embedded version of IntlPop.html. That really only gives you the
ability to open one or more simulation windows (instances of
Simulation.html), where all the action takes place.

WARNING: You must serve these pages using a web server. You cannot
just open the pages as files on, say, a Windows PC that has no web
server. If you want to test these files on a local machine without a
web server, if you have Python installed then you can do the
following from a command shell when in the IntlPop directory:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then, point your web browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you will
be in the directory where you started the server.
