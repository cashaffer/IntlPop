parseData.py
---

The data for IntlPop 3 comes from the UN's [World Population Prospects database](http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm).

We do not redistribute this database as the large files are not necessary to run the program. We generate our country data files, located in the `CountryData` directory, by first converting a series of UN Excel files to CSV and then running the script `parseData.py`.

Run without the optional flags, the parseData script takes CSV files as input and outputs a series of JSON files, each of which contains a compilation of demographic data unique to a specific country or region. Options exist to download the data directly from the UN or to create the `countrylist.json` file.

the parseData usage is as follows:

	Usage: python parseData.py [-d|--download] [-c|--countrylist] <date>
	Date can be 2000, 2005, or 2010.
	Optional Flags:
	  -d | --download     : Downloads raw data directly from the UN.
	                        This option should be used if you have not previously
	                        downloaded any raw data.
	  -c | --countrylist  : Generates countrylist.json, an array of country objects
	                        containing names, aliases, country codes, and relevant
	                        country-specific file names generated by this script.

If you have not previously downloaded the raw data from the united nations, you should run the python script for the first time as follows:

	$ python parseData.py -d -c 2010

Note that for the -d option to work properly, you will need to have the 'requests' and 'xlrd' python packages installed. Using PIP, you can install these packages by running the following in a terminal window:

	$ pip install requests
	$ pip install xlrd

All other packages used by this script are part of the standard python library.
